1. What is HTMl?
HTML (`HyperText Markup Language`) is the markup language (`text-based syntax using tags to define document structure`) that instructs browsers how to parse, structure, and render web content into the DOM tree that users interact with.

2. What are the main features of HTML?
### 1. Platform Independent

HTML works on any device and browser.

### 2. Simple and Easy to Learn

HTML uses human-readable English keywords with simple angle bracket syntax, making it accessible to beginners.

### 3. Markup Language

HTML is a declarative (describes what you want, not how to do it) markup language that structures content using tags like headings, paragraphs, and lists.

### 4. Hypertext Support

HTML enables linking between documents and pages.


### 5. Multimedia Support

HTML natively supports images, videos, and audio in multiple formats.

3. What are HTML tags?
HTML tags are keywords enclosed in angle brackets `< >` that tell the browser how to structure and display content.

An HTML element consists of:
- Opening tag: `<tagname>`
- Content: The actual text or media
- Closing tag: `</tagname>`
