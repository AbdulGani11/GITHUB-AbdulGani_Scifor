1. What is CSS and why do we use it in web development?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that styles HTML elements. The "cascading" means styles flow down from parent elements to children. CSS determines how your webpage looks: colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and positioning. Without CSS, websites would display as plain text with browser defaults. CSS is also used to apply responsiveness to a webpage.




2. Explain the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS with examples.

CSS can be written in three ways:

- Inline styles: Style attributes directly on HTML elements

- Internal styles: We use `<style>` Tag/Block  within HTML document.

- External stylesheets: Create a Separate `.css` files linked to HTML




3. Define the CSS box model and describe its components.

The CSS Box Model is how browsers calculate the total space an element takes up.

Every HTML element is essentially a rectangular box made up of 4 layers: content, padding, border, and margin. 

A: Content
- The actual content (text, images, etc.)
- Benefit: Displays the information  

B: Padding
- Space between content and border (inside the element)
- Benefit: Makes content breathable and easier to read

C: Border
- The edge/outline around the padding
- Benefit: Creates visual boundaries between elements

D: Margin
- creates space between elements i.e, outside the element (pushes other elements away).




4. What is the difference between id and class selectors in CSS?

- Class selector
It is used to apply the same styles to multiple elements or create reusable design patterns.

- id selector
It is used to target a single element with a unique ID.
